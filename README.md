# Frontend Developer Challenge
## Live Demo : https://ghostfrontendchallenge.netlify.app/
Implement a web page, which contains 3 tabs (Upcoming Campaigns, Live Campaign, Past campaigns).


* Each tab should show relevant data based on the status of campaign (upcoming, live, past).
* The very first column should show the time diff from today to that campaign's date. (You can consider any date. If the date is in the future, you can show the number of days in the future. For example, "23 days ahead")
* Add functionality to reschedule a campaign by opening a calendar on clicking the Schedule again icon. (Whatever date you select, should be shown in the first column named "Date". *The time diff shown against it should also be updated).
* Once the date is changed of campaign. The campaign should move to the relevant Tab (Upcoming,Live,Past) , based on the date selected.
* Clicking on View Pricing in the row should show a modal with relevant information of the campaign. See the design in the Specs section below
* Entire UI should be responsive.. Please use your judgement on how it should look on mobile devices
